                            <h3>Access to financing is solving the water crisis for millions</h3>
                            <p>We use access to affordable financing to bring safe water and sanitation to the world,
                                and it is working. Through years of experience, we found that millions of people were
                                paying high prices for water from vendors or collecting water from unsafe natural
                                sources. Both options cost families in time, money, opportunities and health.</p>
                            <p>For millions of people, financing makes sense. Small, affordable loans offer families the
                                ability to purchase long-term safe water and sanitation solutions that solve their
                                immediate need and over time will cost less than continuing to pay for temporary fixes.
                            </p>
                            <p>Water.org believes that access to capital is the most important barrier to overcome in
                                order to solve the global water crisis. We have broadened our efforts and joined forces
                                with others to increase financing for water and sanitation, helping even more people in
                                need.</p>
