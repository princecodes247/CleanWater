                            <h3>The water crisis is a health crisis</h3>
                            <p>Globally, 785 million people lack access to safe water and 2 billion people don’t have a
                                toilet. Nearly 1 million people die each year from water, sanitation and hygiene-related
                                diseases which could be reduced with access to safe water or sanitation. Lack of access
                                to safe water also affects the physical well-being of women and children who have no
                                choice but to carry heavy vessels long distances. As we face the COVID-19 pandemic, now
                                more than ever access to safe water is critical to the health of families around the
                                world.</p>

                                Further, every 2 minutes a child dies from a water-borne disease. Whether they are
                                consuming contaminated water or suffering from dehydration due to diarrhea, a lack of

                                physical strain of these activities impacts their health and if pregnant, the health of
                                their unborn children. Improved water, sanitation and hygiene practices lead to improved
                                health for women and girls. It reduces disease, undernutrition, injury from water
                                collection, and stress.</p>
